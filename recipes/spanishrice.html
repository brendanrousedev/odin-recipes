    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Onion and Garlic</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Jalapeno pepper</li>
        <li>Dried oregano</li>
        <li>Vegetable broth</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            First, rinse the rice. This is my first step whenever I’m cooking rice, 
            as it removes starches that can cause the rice to clump. Place it in a fine
             mesh strainer set over a bowl, and rinse it under cool running water until
              the water in the bowl runs clear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, sauté the onion and toast the rice. Heat the olive oil in a medium 
            pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it’s soft 
            and translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the rice and cook, stirring often, for another 2 minutes, until it’s fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then, add the remaining ingredients. Stir in the tomato paste and garlic, 
            followed by the diced tomatoes or tomato sauce, jalapeño, salt, and oregano.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the broth, and bring it to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce the heat, cover the pot, and simmer the rice for 15 minutes, or until
             the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, let the rice steam. Remove it from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
