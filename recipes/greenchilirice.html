        <li>One 4-ounce can mild green chiles</li>
        <li>1 cup coarsely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>½ cup spinach</li>
        <li>4 cups Vegetable Stock, or low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1½ cups medium-grain brown rice</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, peeled and diced small</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add the poblano pepper, green chiles, cilantro, and spinach to a blender and puree. 
            Add some of the Vegetable stock, as needed, to achieve a smooth consistency. Add the 
            mixture to a medium saucepan with the remaining vegetable stock. Add the brown rice 
            and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, until
             the rice is tender, 45 to 50 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the onion in a large saucepan and sauté over medium heat for 7 to 8 minutes. Add 
            water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time to keep the onion from sticking to the pan. Add the 
            cumin, jalapeño pepper, and black beans and cook for 5 minutes longer. Fold in the cooked
             rice and lime zest. Season with salt.
        </li>
    </ol>
