        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the rice: Was the rice and allow to soak in 1.2 litres of water for 30 min.</li>
            <li>Add 2 dried shiitake mushrooms to the rice: allow to soak for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar: After 10 minutes, remove the shiitake mushrooms
                and add the sugar to the rice and allow to rest for a further 30 minutes.
                Cover the rice with cling film.
            </li>
            <li>Cut the vegetables: You can leave the skin on the carrots if you want. If you have a food 
                cutter available, cutting the carrot slices into shapes adds a nice decorative touch to
                the final product.
            </li>
            <li>Add the rice and water to the rice cooker: add 5 tbsp tsuyu soup base,
                1 tsp salt, 5 tbsp cooking sake, and 1 tbsp olive oil. Add 150g of diced
                chicken thigh, carrot clices, and shiitake mushroom. Then switch on the
                rice cooker.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the green beans: While the rice is cooking, blanch 150g green beans in boiling 
                water for a few minutes. Then run under cold water, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve and enjoy: After the rice has finished, stir the rice until everything is nicely
                dispersed. Top with the blanched green beans, 100g chopped chestnuts in 
                syrup, and 25g walnuts.
            </li>
        </ol>
