This is a basic recipe website to help me practice
writing meaningful commit messages, as well as providing links
to other websites and embedding images


Good commit messages should:
Provide a subject that specifies the code's action
Contains a body that provides a concise yet clear description of why the commits needed to be made
Separates the subject from the body with a new/blank line so it is easier for devs to read

Notes:
index.html is the typical file name for the homepage of a website
